 * (CheckpointReactor) and the on-demand Review path (CheckpointDiffQuery) must
 * decide identically whether an instance is reachable for that diff — a diverging
 * gate would route one path to the sandbox while the other captured an empty host
 * checkpoint. This is the one place that decision lives.
