 *
 * Every concrete execution-runtime provider (fake-remote today; Daytona, Vercel,
 * Modal, Cloudflare in later increments) conforms to this shape, so the service
 * routes by provider through `RuntimeProviderRegistry.getAdapter` without ever
 * naming a concrete provider. The Effect error and requirement channels match the
 * fake adapter exactly so the fake conforms through a thin facade rather than a
 * lossy down-cast. Provider→descriptor resolution stays the registry's job; this
 * surface is lifecycle-only.
