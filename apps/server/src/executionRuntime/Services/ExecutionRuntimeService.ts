/**
 * ExecutionRuntimeService - The orchestration-facing seam for *where* a thread's
 * agent process runs.
 *
 * The provider command reactor calls only this service (plus `ProviderService`):
 * it never references a concrete runtime provider's ids, states, or routes. For
 * `local`/`worktree` threads this resolves the existing workspace cwd and does
 * no provisioning, preserving current behavior exactly. For `remote-runtime`
 * threads it routes to the resolved adapter, provisions an instance, and records
 * the resolved facts through internal orchestration commands so runtime state is
 * event-sourced and survives reconnect.
 *
 * `exec` starts a process inside an instance and returns its line transport
 * (the same `JsonRpcLineTransport` Codex consumes), recording process lifecycle
 * events. `destroy` tears the instance down idempotently.

 * @module ExecutionRuntimeService
