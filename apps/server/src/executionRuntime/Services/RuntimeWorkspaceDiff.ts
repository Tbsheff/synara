/**
 * RuntimeWorkspaceDiff - Provider-agnostic working-tree diff for a remote
 * instance's cloned repo.
 *
 * A remote-runtime thread's agent edits the sandbox, not the host repo, so the
 * host CheckpointStore has nothing to diff. This seam runs `git` inside the
 * instance through the provider's exec channel (resolved by provider from
 * `RuntimeProviderRegistry`) and returns the unified working-tree diff plus the
 * path of every changed file. The caller supplies the instance's provider and
 * root from the persisted runtime row, so this service holds no per-instance
 * state — keeping it a thin, cycle-free dependency that both
 * `ExecutionRuntimeService` and `CheckpointDiffQuery` consume.
 *
 * Best-effort: a missing/destroyed instance, an exec failure, or a non-repo
 * workdir degrades to an empty-but-clean diff. It never throws.
 *
 * @module RuntimeWorkspaceDiff
