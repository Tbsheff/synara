/**
 * CloudflareBridgeConnection - The raw transport seam under the bridge client.
 *
 * Splits *how bytes move* (an authenticated HTTP round-trip and a WebSocket
 * connect) from *what the bridge means* (the typed routes in
 * `CloudflareBridgeClient`). Production binds this to Effect `HttpClient` + the
 * `ws` library; the contract test binds an in-process fake that needs no network.
 * Keeping the connection a separate service is what lets the bridge client's
 * route logic be tested without a live bridge or real credentials.
