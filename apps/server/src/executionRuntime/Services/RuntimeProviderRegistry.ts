/**
 * RuntimeProviderRegistry - Lookup boundary mapping an execution-runtime
 * provider to its descriptor and its lifecycle adapter.
 *
 * The planner uses descriptor lookup to resolve what a `RuntimePlan` is
 * validated against. `ExecutionRuntimeService` uses adapter lookup to route
 * provisioning, exec, and teardown by provider, so it never names a concrete
 * provider. The registry owns no lifecycle of its own and makes no provider
 * calls; it only resolves the registered descriptor/adapter.
