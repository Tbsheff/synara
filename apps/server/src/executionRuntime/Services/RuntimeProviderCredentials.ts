/**
 * RuntimeProviderCredentials - resolves the credential env map a runtime provider
 * uses to pick its real-vs-fake client.
 *
 * The provider credential resolvers (`resolveDaytonaCredentials`,
 * `resolveVercelSandboxCredentials`, `resolveModalCredentials`, and the Cloudflare
 * bridge gate) read an injectable env map defaulting to `process.env`. This
 * service produces that map for a given provider by overlaying configured values
 * onto `process.env`:
 *
 *   1. start from `process.env` (the legacy fallback — keeps behavior identical
 *      when nothing is configured),
 *   2. overlay the non-secret fields persisted in `ServerSettings.sandboxes.*`,
 *   3. overlay the secret-bearing fields read from `ServerSecretStore` by name
 *      (`runtime/<provider>/<key>`), which is where the raw tokens actually live.
 *
 * Configured values win; env is the fallback. A field left blank in settings does
 * not clobber an env var of the same name, so a credentialed shell still resolves
 * the real client when settings are empty. The raw secret never round-trips to the
 * client and is never logged: only the resolver reads it, here, to build the env
 * map the provider client consumes.
