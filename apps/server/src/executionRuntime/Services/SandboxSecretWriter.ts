/**
 * SandboxSecretWriter - routes secret-bearing remote-sandbox settings into
 * `ServerSecretStore` and strips them from the patch persisted to settings.json.
 *
 * The remote-sandbox settings schema carries both non-secret fields (apiUrl,
 * teamId, runtime, ...) and secret-bearing fields (apiKey, token, tokenSecret,
 * bridgeToken). The non-secret fields belong in `ServerSettings`; the raw tokens
 * must NOT — `settings.json` is plaintext and round-trips to every web client on
 * `getSettings`. This writer intercepts an incoming `ServerSettingsPatch`, writes
 * each present secret field to `ServerSecretStore` by name
 * (`runtime/<provider>/<field>`), and returns a patch with those fields removed so
 * only non-secret values reach the settings file. The token is never echoed back.
 *
