/**
 * DaytonaRuntimeProviderFacade unit tests.
 *
 * Pins the provider-agnostic surface the registry resolves: the facade routes
 * `refreshActivity` (the activity-lease keepalive the service renews on a timer)
 * through to the concrete Daytona adapter, and swallows a provider failure so a
 * failed keepalive never breaks the renew loop. Uses a recording stub adapter so
 * no Daytona client or provider access is involved.
 *
 * @module DaytonaRuntimeProviderFacade.test
