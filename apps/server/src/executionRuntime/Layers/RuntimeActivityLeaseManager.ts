/**
 * RuntimeActivityLeaseManagerLive - In-memory activity-lease bookkeeping.
 *
 * A lease is taken on active work (turn, terminal, preview) and released on
 * exit/close. This v1 keeps the leases in memory and hides the per-provider
 * keepalive shape behind acquire / renew / release; real providers later plug
 * their refresh call (Daytona refresh, Vercel timeout-extend, Modal idle-timeout
 * respect, Cloudflare renew) behind these same three operations. The
 * orchestration seam never sees provider-specific keepalive.
