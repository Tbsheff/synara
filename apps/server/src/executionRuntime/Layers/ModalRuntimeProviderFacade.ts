/**
 * ModalRuntimeProviderFacade - adapts the Modal runtime adapter to the
 * provider-agnostic `ExecutionRuntimeProviderAdapterShape` the registry resolves.
 *
 * Modal is the one provider keyed by an internal `ModalRuntimeRole` rather than a
 * plan, analogous to the fake's flavor. This facade owns the
 * `RuntimePlan -> ModalRuntimeRole` derivation (mirroring `deriveFakeFlavor`): a
 * plan that asks for ports lands on the ingress-capable `service` role; a plan
 * with no ports lands on the one-shot `job` role. `provision` forwards the
 * derived role and drops it from the result so the service stays provider-
 * agnostic. `createTransport`/`execCollect` already carry the same
 * `ChildProcessSpawner` requirement the common shape declares and Modal's exec
 * channel cannot fail (a non-zero exit is a terminal job result, not a provider
 * fault), so both pass through unchanged. Provider-only operations
 * (`exposePort`/`descriptorForRole`/`backendKind`) stay on the concrete adapter
 * for the ingress/lease slices to call directly.
 *
 * Mirrors `FakeRuntimeProviderFacade`: the service never learns Modal's roles or
 * input shape.
 *
