/**
 * FakeRuntimeProviderFacade - adapts the fake-remote runtime adapter to the
 * provider-agnostic `ExecutionRuntimeProviderAdapterShape` the registry resolves.
 *
 * The fake adapter provisions by an internal `FakeRuntimeFlavor`; the common
 * surface provisions by a public `RuntimePlan`. This facade owns that
 * translation: `provision({ threadId, plan })` derives the fake flavor from the
 * plan and forwards to the fake adapter, dropping the flavor from the result so
 * the service stays provider-agnostic. Every other operation passes through
 * unchanged. Flavor derivation lives here, not in `ExecutionRuntimeService`, so
 * the service never knows the fake's sub-kinds exist.
 *
 * @module FakeRuntimeProviderFacade

 * non-persistent plan lands on the throwaway ephemeral flavor, which exposes no
 * ports and no snapshots — so a non-persistent plan that still asks for ports or
