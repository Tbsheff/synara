/**
 * VercelSandboxClient - the thin provider boundary the Vercel Sandbox adapter
 * talks to.
 *
 * This is the only place that knows the shape of the Vercel Sandbox API. The
 * adapter is written against this interface so it can run unchanged against
 * either the real client (gated behind env credentials) or the in-memory fake
 * used by the contract tests when no credentials are present. Vercel Sandbox is
 * command/log/file/preview-first: there is no PTY and no host pid, ports are
 * declared at create time, and the filesystem is ephemeral unless snapshotted.
 *
 * Every operation here is provider-native (a sandbox id, a command stream, a
 * file path inside the sandbox). The adapter maps these onto the runtime-neutral
 * `RuntimeInstanceSummary` / `JsonRpcLineTransport` / git-exec contracts the rest
 * of the system consumes; this interface stays Vercel-shaped.
 *
 * @module VercelSandboxClient
