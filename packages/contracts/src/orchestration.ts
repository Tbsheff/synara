// Purpose: Public entry for orchestration contracts. Owns the WebSocket method/
//   channel maps and re-exports the cohesive sub-modules (core read-model shapes,
//   commands, events/RPC) so consumers keep a single `@synara/contracts` surface.
// Layer: contracts (schema-only)
// Exports: ORCHESTRATION_WS_METHODS, ORCHESTRATION_WS_CHANNELS, the providerKind
//   re-exports, and everything from orchestration.core / .commands / .events.
